# The beginning

Wow I can't believe I'm actually going to blog. This is my first time sharing my thoughts on the internet so I'm pretty nervous...\
Anyways let's try it out and see how it goes.

In this blog post, I'll share a little more about myself, and what I plan on using this blog for.

## About me
My name is Richard, a second year student from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I a currently studying Computer Science and Business double degree as an undergraduate.
After being in this course for 1.5 years, I've got to say... I REALLY ENJOY WHAT I'M LEARNING! 

As cliche as it sounds, it really made me see the world from a whole new perspective! 

## Journey so far
Here's the courses I've taken so far:
- Introduction to Computational Thinking (ICT) -> logical thinking, python, GUI
- Discrete Math -> mathematical proofs, essential math for computer science
- Engineering Math 1&2 -> Calculus, Linear Algebra
- Introduction to Statistics & Probability -> distributions, basic R, statistics
- Data Stuctures -> data structures, C
- Introduction to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence -> ML models (linear regression, logistic regression, k means clustering, outlier detection),
ML pipeline
 - Algorithms -> complexity analysis, algorithms, greedy algorithms, complexity theory
 - Object Oriented Design and Programming -> OOP, class and sequence diagrams, java
- Financial Management -> stocks, bonds, valuation
- Marketing -> evaluation metrics, 4Ps (price, product, place, promotion), marketing theories
- Business Analytics I -> data cleaning, data exploration, linear regression, logistic regression, CART, text mining, R 


I've got to say, even though some of the courses are probably not going to be useful to what my job is in the future, they are definitely still worth taking because
they make me a more well-rounded person. It makes me appreciate the world and the society we live in. If anyone was to ask me if I regret taking the double degree,
my answer is a definitive 'no'. \
It is definitely challenging, but the reward is that you become more aware of your surroundings, and makes me a more critical thinker.

## Future aspirations
In the future, I hope to embark in a job that deals with data, specifically Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence. At the same time, I hope to contribute to 
businesses and companies by applying these skill sets to improve the workflow of such companies, and help them leverage on the power of data to bring companies the 
competitive edge.

Ok that's it for this first blog. I hope to continue this and start posting on more interesting topics. My first goal is to finish the fast.ai Practical Deep Learning
for Coders Course.\
I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Machine Learning in general! Jeremy Howard is excellent at his craft and his lectures have shed so much insights 
even for me, someone who has just started his journey.

Till next time, bye!
